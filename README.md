# Malaria_Cell_Classification_with_ResNet50
In this project, I have used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using ResNet50 Pre-Trained Model to classify Malaria cell images as Parasitized or Uninfected. The dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria. I have split the dataset into 80% training and 20% validation sets. The total number of training and testing images are 22046 and 5512 respectively. The dataset contains equal number of images in both the classes. I have implemented the code using tensorflow and keras. I have obtained a validation accuracy of over 86%, training for 10 epochs only
